        <h2   >Description</h2>
        <p class="PERSO2">A bûche de Noël is a sponge cake that is typically served around Christmastime. It's believed to have originated in France during the 19th century. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The cake is filled with frosting and rolled to look like a log. It can also be decorated with frosting to make it more log-like or a simple dusting of confectioners' sugar to resemble snow on a log. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul id="PERSO">
            <li >2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 egg whites</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li> confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>  
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whip cream, 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa, and 1 teaspoon vanilla until thick and stiff.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat egg yolks with 1/2 cup sugar until pale in color, light and frothy.</li>
            <li>Blend in 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla, and salt. In large glass bowl, using clean beaters, whip egg whites to soft peaks.</li>
            <li>Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar, and beat until whites form stiff peaks.</li>
            <li>Immediately fold the yolk mixture into the whites.</li>
            <li>Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cake springs back when lightly touched.</li>
            <li>Dust a clean dishtowel with confectioners' sugar.</li>
            <li>Run a knife around the edge of the pan, and turn the warm cake out onto the towel.</li>
            <li>Remove and discard parchment paper. Starting at the short edge of the cake, roll the cake up with the towel.</li>
            <li>Cool for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Unroll the cake, and spread the filling to within 1 inch of the edge.</li>
            <li>Roll the cake up with the filling inside.</li>
            <li>Place seam side down onto a serving plate, and refrigerate until serving.</li>
            <li>Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.</li>
        </ol>
