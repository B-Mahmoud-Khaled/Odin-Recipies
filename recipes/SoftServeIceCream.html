        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When you think about cool, contemporary desserts taking the food world by storm, there are two words that likely don't come to mind: soft serve. As in, soft serve ice cream. But while we were busy marveling at gooey-centered molten chocolate cake – and while molecular gastronomists were whipping ice cream over liquid nitrogen – soft serve ice cream was making a serious comeback, in New York, LA, Portland, and beyond. Here's more on the trend – and two easy ways to make your own soft serve at home.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound strawberries</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup light corn syrup</li>
            <li>1/3 cup water</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp xanthan gum (a natural stablizer that's easy to find at specialty supermarkets)</li>
            <li>1 cupcoconut cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Making the Base</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the green tops from the strawberries and slice them into perfect slices.</li>
            <li>Toss the berries in sugar until they are completely coated and cook in a 350-degree oven until they are perfectly cooked, slightly caramelized, and overwhelmingly aromatic, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the strawberries from the oven and allow to cool to room temp.</li>
            <li>Once the berries are cooled, puree them really well with a blender.</li>
            <li>Pass the berries through a fine mesh strainer to get out most of the remaining pulp and seeds.</li>
            <li>Stir together about one fourth of the sugar with all of the xanthan gum in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour the water in a small saucepan, add the sugar mixture and immediately whisk vigorously until very smooth (don't fret over a few lumps). Stir in the corn syrup.</li>
            <li>Set the pan over medium heat and cook, stirring often and adjusting the heat if necessary to prevent a simmer, until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and immediately whisk in the strained berry puree and the coconut cream.</li>
            <li>Transfer the soft serve base into an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, about four hours, or, for even better texture and flavor, 24 hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3> Churning the Soft Serve </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the soft serve base into a standard at-home ice cream maker and turn on the machine.</li>
            <li>Churn just until the mixture has the desired texture of soft serve, about 15 to 25 minutes depending on the machine.</li>
            <li>Use a spatula to scoop all of the ice cream into a piping bag and pipe the ice cream out into a cone!</li>
            <li>This soft serve could be stored, covered, in the freezer for up to two weeks but should be very tediously tempered before eating after being frozen.</li>
        </ol>
